Dear sir
I have resigned on.... My notice period ends on... But now I am unable to serve for the three months of notice period as the university I took admission in, wants my physical presence for the course I am enrolled in.  Therefore, you are requested to consider the reduction in the notice period and bring it to at least two months. I have spoken to ASKHR for the same and they mentioned that it totally depends on the line manager and business unit.

I have 16.5 days of leave balance. You are requested to adjust the same in the notice period. It would be great if we can have a meeting regarding this.
